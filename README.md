Note: change path_to_csv to the correct location. 

In the jupyter notebook, I go over the step by step implementation of a personalized recommendation system for movies. 

I first created a bipartite graph from user ratings and movies, then used the Node2Vec algorithm for learning the vector embeddings for users and movies. 

Please follow the comments inside the notebook for more details.
